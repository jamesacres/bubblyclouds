      <h5>Bubbly Clouds Responsibilities</h5>
      <p className="my-8">
        When signing in or making a payment for one of our services you enter a
        contract with us to become an account holder or customer of ours. In
        this scenario Bubbly Clouds has the legal basis to become a controller
        of the necessary personal data we are required to collect from you in
        order to provide you with the service you accessed, collect payment and
        keep you notified of renewals etc.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        We are only data controllers of our own customers&#39; data. Bubbly
        Clouds has the role of data processor when our customers use the
        products we provide to them for their own purposes. Our customers are
        data controllers when using our services to provide their own services
        to their own users.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        Bubbly Clouds will always provide info on, and enforce our{' '}
        <Link href="terms">Terms of Service</Link> and{' '}
        <Link href="privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> so our own services process
        data securely.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        All our systems collect data for robust breach detection, investigation
        and internal reporting procedures so we can prevent and detect breaches
        and keep a record of them if they were to occur.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        Within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach we will
        notify the UK&#39;s ICO and if this is of high risk of adversely
        affecting individuals’ rights and freedoms we will notify those
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        If one of our sub-processors notify us about a breach that impacts our
        customer&#39;s data we will notify them.

        You are in control of your own application setup it is up to you to
        install your own monitoring to prevent and detect breaches. We can

        services we offer are unmanaged.

        Some third parties help us to take payments and provide you with
        services, in some cases you will provide your data directly to their
        servers instead of to us, in these cases they will be the controller of
        your data for that purpose instead of Bubbly Clouds and you will need to
        read their own privacy policy to decide if it adequately protects your
        data.

        protection. In particular, Bubbly Clouds may release the information it
        collects to third parties when we believe that it is appropriate to
